resetRegions(x): 
   You have suggested resetting the regions that appear free 
   in the type scheme with place of 'x', i.e., in
   (string,`r)
   I have NOT done as you requested.
   Here are my reasons, (one for each region variable concerned):
   (1)                                                    
        '`r': there is a conflict with the locally
        live variable
        x :(string,`r)
        from which the following region variables can be reached 
        in the region flow graph:
             {`r}
        Amongst these, '`r' can also be reached from '`r'.
        Thus I have given '`r' storage mode "attop".
