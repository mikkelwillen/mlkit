forceResetting(x): 
   You have requested resetting the regions that appear free 
   in the type scheme with place of 'x', i.e., in
   (string,`r)
   I have done as you requested, but I cannot guarantee that it is safe.
   Here are my objections (one for each region variable concerned):
   (1)                                                    
        I cannot reset '`r', because of conflict with the locally
        live variable
        x :(string,`r)
        from which the following region variables can be reached 
        in the region flow graph:
             {`r}
        Amongst these, '`r' can also be reached from '`r'.
        This suggests that you may be destroying data in '`r'.
