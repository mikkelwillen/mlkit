resetRegions(x2): 
   You have suggested resetting the regions that appear free 
   in the type scheme with place of 'x2', i.e., in
   (string,`r2)
   I have NOT done as you requested.
   Here are my reasons, (one for each region variable concerned):
   (1)                                                    
        '`r2': there is a conflict with the locally
        live variable
        x2 :(string,`r2)
        from which the following region variables can be reached 
        in the region flow graph:
             {`r2}
        Amongst these, '`r2' can also be reached from '`r2'.
        Thus I have given '`r2' storage mode "attop".
   (2)                                                    
        '`r1': there is a conflict with the locally
        live variable
        x1 :(string,`r1)
        from which the following region variables can be reached 
        in the region flow graph:
             {`r1}
        Amongst these, '`r1' can also be reached from '`r1'.
        Thus I have given '`r1' storage mode "attop".
